Karma to Burn

Purpose and Overview:

The purpose of this application is to promote healthy living and regulate decadence. It is as much for myself as it is for you. It is a sometimes not-so-friendly reminder that in order to spend karma, you should first earn it.

In his 1943 paper, 'A Theory of Human Motivation', Abraham Maslow asserts that physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, self-actualization and self-transcendence are the underlying needs of human beings. This assertion is commonly referred to as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. The user of this application is awarded (or berated) based by his/her general ability to satiate these needs. As such, Karma to Burn is loosely based on the Hierarchy of Needs.

The user is prompted questions about his/her daily exploits which require a 'true' or 'false' response. One Karma Point is awarded for every response that demonstrates a satiated need. No Karma Points are awarded for a response that demonstrates otherwise. Karma Points are tallied and stored after all daily responses have been submitted. After daily responses have been submitted, the user has the options to redeem Karma Points for minutes of earned leisure or view progress a progress report.

A user can log Karma Points only once a day though he/she can return to the program any number of times a day to view progress and/or spend Karma Points (assuming the user has a balance of more than 0 Karma Points).

Usage Instructions:

To run the program, the user must type 'ruby ktb'. Thereafter, user entry instructions are provided by the application itself.

Project Status:

As of 05-27-2013, this application effectively prompts users, renders responses, and aggregates data accordingly. 

Known Bugs:

As of 05-27-2013, there is an issue aggregating data for multiple users with the same name. A first user with any name can be successfully added to the SQLite Database with no issue. However, should a second user with the same name as the first user get entered, the SQLite database does not create and store a unique id for this second user. This does not apply to multiple users with the same date of birth.

To Do:

1. The known bug as of 05-27-2013 needs to be addressed
2. It may be beneficial to include individual categories on the progress chart

Demo:

To demo this application, you must download it and try it yourself.
