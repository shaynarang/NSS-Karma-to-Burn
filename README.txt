Karma to Burn

Purpose and Overview:

The purpose of this application is to promote essential living and regulate decadence. It is as much for myself as it is for you. It is a not-so-friendly reminder that in order to 'spend karma' via decadent living, you should 'earn karma' first via essential living.

Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs provides the criteria for what I have termed essential living. In his 1943 paper, 'A Theory of Human Motivation', Maslow asserts that physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, self-actualization and self-transcendence are the underlying needs for human beings. The user is judged by his/her ability to satiate the aforementioned needs and hence, live essentially.

The user is prompted questions about his/her daily exploits that require a 'yes' or 'no' response. One Karma Point is earned for every response that demonstrates a satiated need. One Karma Point is deducted for every response that demonstrates otherwise. Karma Points are tallied and stored after all daily responses have been submitted.

After the user has accumulated a certain number of Karma Points, he/she has the option to redeem Karma Points for justifiably engaging in decadent activities. The user will be bestowed a list of options at each point value. The more Karma Points, the more decadent the options. For example, five points will earn the user justifiable consumption of an ice-cream sundae. Twenty points will earn the user a justifiable trip to the movies. These are simply examples. There are multiple options for each point value. The user can choose if and when he/she would like to redeem Karma Points. They do not expire.
