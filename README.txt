Karma to Burn

Purpose and Overview:

The purpose of this application is to promote healthy living and regulate decadence. It is as much for myself as it is for you. It is a sometimes not-so-friendly reminder that in order to spend karma, you should first earn it.

In his 1943 paper, 'A Theory of Human Motivation', Abraham Maslow asserts that physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, self-actualization and self-transcendence are underlying needs for human beings. This assertion is commonly referred to as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. The user of this application is awarded (or berated) based by his/her ability to satiate these needs.

The user is prompted questions about his/her daily exploits that require a 'yes' or 'no' response. One Karma Point is awarded for every response that demonstrates a satiated need. One Karma Point is deducted for every response that demonstrates otherwise. Karma Points are tallied and stored after all daily responses have been submitted.

After the user has accumulated a number of Karma Points, he/she has the option to redeem them at the Karma Store. The user will be bestowed a list of 'reward activities' at each point value. The more Karma Points, the more decadent the options. For example, five points will earn the user consumption of an ice-cream sundae. Twenty points will earn the user a trip to the movies. These are simply examples. There are multiple options for each point value. The user can choose if and when he/she would like to redeem Karma Points. They do not expire.
